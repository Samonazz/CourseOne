<h1>Elemental Shaman</h1>
<p>Elemental Shaman is a mail-wearing ranged DPS caster with many great spell effects and different flavours of abilities, wielding Nature, Fire and Frost spells to damage its opponents.</p>
    
<p>We can use staffs or one-handed maces with shields and, depending on our builds, switch between very sturdy and very mobile depending on the encounter.</p>
    
<p>As a class with a healing specialization in Restoration, we excel at off-healing our teammates and, in general, providing various utility with our totems.</p>
    
<p>Elemental Shaman is the spec to play for people who love playing a caster that can specialize in helping their teammates or just like to look at impressive spell effects.</p>

    <h2>How to play Elemental Shaman</h2>
    <p>
        This is a guide on how to use your rotations as an Elemental Shaman & what consumables you are supposed to use.
    </p>

    <div class="articles"> <!-- Added this div to wrap articles -->

            <h3>Rotation</h3> <!-- Changed h7 to h3 for proper heading -->
            <p>
                Pre-cast Storm Elemental 3 seconds before pull. Ensure not to have any enemies targeted; otherwise, this might pull.
                Pre-cast Stormkeeper about 1.5 seconds before pull.
                Cast Primordial Wave to apply Flame Shock
            Cast  Ascendance.
            Cast  Lava Burst.
        </p>
        <p>
            Openers for Lightning builds depend a lot on the amount of Maelstrom Maelstrom you can get to at different points. In other words, in a mythic+ pull, going into a fight with Maelstrom Maelstrom allows you to easily  Surge of Power every  Stormkeeper-empowered  Lightning Bolt.
            The raid opener allows you to get  Master of the Elements on one of these strong  Lightning Bolts and  Surge of Power on another. This currently seems to be the optimal way to perform the opener.
            Be aware that while  Storm Elemental is not a "hostile" ability and would not put you into combat immediately, some trinkets have been known to proc on it regardless. This can easily lead to pre-pulls.

        <h3>Consumebles</h3>
        <p>
            You should be drinking Flask of Alchemical Chaos Icon Flask of Alchemical Chaos.
            Your stat potion should be Tempered Potion Icon Tempered Potion. Use these when you will do the most damage with your abilities, likely during your cooldowns and/or Bloodlust Icon Bloodlust/Heroism Icon Heroism.

        </p>
        <p>
            You should keep a stock of Algari Healing Potion Icon Algari Healing Potions to use when at low health, and if you have a Warlock in the group, grab their Healthstone Icon Healthstones and use them as well. Do not macro these together, they are best used separately! You can also obtain Fleeting Algari Healing Potion Icon Fleeting Algari Healing Potion from Cauldrons that can be spawned by Alchemists.
